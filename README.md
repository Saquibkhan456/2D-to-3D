# Depth-Based Image Perspective Transformation App

This Python application uses depth estimation to apply transformations to an image in a 3D space. It employs Gradio to provide an interactive web interface where users can adjust camera properties such as field of view and rotation angles to see real-time changes in the image perspective.

## Features

- **Depth Estimation**: Automatically estimate the depth map of an image using DepthAnything.
- **3D Transformation**: Adjust field of view, rotation, and translation parameters to warp the image based on depth.
- **Interactive Interface**: Control parameters with Gradio sliders and see real-time transformation results.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Conda (recommended for environment management)

### Install Dependencies

To install the required packages, create a new Conda environment and install dependencies:

```bash
conda create -n depth_transform python=3.9
conda activate depth_transform
pip install requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### 1. Run the App

Run the application from the terminal, specifying the path to an input image and optionally a depth map. If no depth map is provided, the app will generate one using the `estimate_depth` module.

#### If depthmap is already available
```bash
python app.py "/path/to/image.jpg" "path/to/depthmap.npy"
```

#### If depthmap is not available and needs to be estimated
```bash
python app.py "/path/to/image.jpg" ""
```

### 2. Interface Controls

The Gradio interface provides sliders to control the following parameters:

- **Field of View (FOV)**: Changes the cameraâ€™s field of view, allowing you to zoom in or out.
- **Rx, Ry, Rz**: Rotate the image along the x, y, and z axes to adjust the viewing angle.
- **Tx, Ty, Tz**: Translate the image along the x, y, and z axes for fine positioning.

### Example

```bash
python app.py images/shocked.jpg
```

Adjust the sliders in the web interface to explore different views of the transformed image.

This project uses PyTorch for depth map handling and image transformations. The interactive GUI is powered by Gradio, making it easy to visualize transformations directly from a web interface.
